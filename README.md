# Backend Development using Nodejs

Here are some of the questions we need to ask before we can start working with Nodejs:

- What is backend development and do I always need a backend?
- Terminology you might have heard
- What are the key pillars of backend development?
- What are some of the key principles of backend development?
- What are some of the common tools used in backend development?

So let's start first by talking about the pillars that form the backbone of backend development.

## What is backend development and do I always need a backend?

Backend development is the process of building the server-side of a website or application. It is the part of the application that handles the logic and data of the application. Think of any website that you may have visited. Think of some of the actions that you had to perform as a user, e.g logging in, searching for a product, adding a product to your cart, etc. 

The Frontend is responsible for the user interface, the button that you click to submit, the form that you fill out, etc. The Backend is responsible for consuming this data, processing it, and returning the appropriate response to the user.

In very simple terms, this is what the backend does. The bigger and more complex an application gets, the more complicated the backend becomes.

It is important to note that a backend is not always needed. If you are building a static website that never changes for example, and is simply for presentation purposes, you don't need a backend. For example most portfolio websites don't need a backend. Try to think of websites that are static and never change.

## Let's shed some light on some key terminologies

- **API**
- **CRUD**
- **HTTP**

## What is an API?

The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a way for two different software applications to communicate with each other. In the real world, this could be compared to a restaurant where you order food. You don't know how the food is prepared or what the kitchen looks like. You just know that you give them an order and they will give you food back. In the same way, an API is a messenger between your application and the other application. You send a message to the API and the API will send the data back to you. It is a way of hiding the complexity of how the data is prepared and only giving you the information that you need.

In the frontend - backend relationship, you Frontend is the consumer of the API and the Backend is the provider of the API. 

## Defining CRUD

The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a way of defining the actions that you can perform on a **database**.

- **Create**: Adding a new record to the database.
- **Read**: Getting a record from the database.
- **Update**: Updating a record in the database.
- **Delete**: Deleting a record from the database.

## What is HTTP?

The acronym HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a standard protocol used for transferring data, including web pages, over the internet. It is a request-response protocol, meaning that a client, such as a web browser, sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back to the client. It is a way of defining the actions that you can perform on a **website**.

- **GET**: Getting a record from the database.
- **POST**: Adding a new record to the database.
- **PUT**: Updating a record in the database.
- **DELETE**: Deleting a record from the database.

ðŸ’¡What other protocals can you think of?
