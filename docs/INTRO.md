# What is Nodejs?

Nodejs is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. What exactly does this mean?

A JavaScript runtime environment is composed of several components:

1. **JavaScript Engine**: This is the core component that interprets and executes JavaScript code. Examples include V8 (used in Node.js and Chrome) and SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox).

2. **Event Loop**: This mechanism handles asynchronous operations, allowing non-blocking execution of code. It manages the execution of code, events, and sub-tasks.

3. **Call Stack**: This is a data structure that records the point in the program to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing.

4. **Web APIs**: These are provided by the runtime environment (e.g., Node.js or browser) to perform tasks like making HTTP requests or manipulating the DOM.

5. **Callback Queue**: This queue holds the callback functions that are ready to be executed after their corresponding asynchronous operations have completed.

6. **Microtask Queue**: A secondary queue for tasks such as Promises, which need to be processed after the current operation completes but before any I/O tasks.

Together, these components enable JavaScript to perform complex tasks efficiently, supporting event-driven, non-blocking I/O operations.

**The Javascript Engine is responsible for executing the code, the Call Stack is responsible for keeping track of the current execution context, and the Event Loop is responsible for handling the asynchronous operations. All these components work together to provide a fast and efficient way of executing JavaScript code.**
